    <p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way: </P>
    <OL>
        <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>

    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <br>"Passing cars,</br>
        <br>When you can't see, May get you,</br>
        <br>A glimpse,</br>
        <br>Of eternity."</br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone</li>
            <li>ipad</li>
            <li>digital</li>
            <li>camera</li>
            <li>a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, </p>
        <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
